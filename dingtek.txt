To configure your DF555 Ultrasonic Level Sensor to use your own server, particularly for GPRS&4G versions, you can use specific downlink commands via a serial port connection
.
Here are the detailed steps:
1. Gather Required Tools
:
    ◦ A TTL tool and wires. This is typically a complimentary accessory, so check your package
.
    ◦ Serial port software. You can use any serial software you have
.
    ◦ Your DF555 device
.
2. Connect TTL to the Sensor
:
    ◦ Connect the TTL tool to the debug interface of your DF555 device
.
    ◦ Crucially, ensure you connect GND_DF555 to GND_TTL
.
    ◦ Then, connect the TTL's USB interface to your computer
.
3. Configure Serial Port Software
:
    ◦ Set the following parameters in your serial port software
:
        ▪ COM Num: Check this in your computer's "Device Manager -> Port"
.
        ▪ Baudrate: 115200
.
        ▪ Parity bit: NONE
.
        ▪ Data bit: 8
.
        ▪ Stop bit: 1
.
    ◦ Important: Do not select the "Receive as hex" option
.
4. Reset/Wake the DF555 Device
:
    ◦ The sensor cannot receive commands if it's in sleep mode
.
    ◦ To ensure it's awake, restart the DF555 device by magnet
. You can do this by moving a magnet down from the red mark on the device and then removing it
.
    ◦ A successful restart is indicated by the red LED on the PCB board lighting up
, and the device will immediately report one data packet
.
5. Send the Server Address Command
:
    ◦ Once the serial port software starts outputting device information, you can send commands in ASCII format
.
    ◦ To set the Server1 address (IP1 and PORT1), use the downlink command with command code 0x06
.
    ◦ The command format is: 8002999906Content81
.
    ◦ The Content part of the command should be your server's IP address and port, formatted as IP1;PORT1;
.
    ◦ Critical Note: You must include two English semicolons at the end of the IP1;PORT1; content; otherwise, the command will fail
.
    ◦ Example: If your server's IP address is 156.23.68.110 and the port is 5000, the command to send in ASCII would be: 8002999906156.23.68.110;5000;81
.
6. Verify Configuration:
    ◦ If the command is configured successfully, you will receive a reply from the sensor
.
Additionally, the DF555 sensor's protocol allows for configuration of a "Server mode" to report data to Server1 only, Server2 only, or both Server1 and Server2 simultaneously
. The protocol also specifies "IP&PORT2" for a second server address
.
For integration with LoRaWAN® network servers, Sigfox® backends, or other third-party applications, CNDINGTEK advises contacting their team to discuss feasibility and quotation
. This suggests that direct integration with these specific types of network servers or general third-party applications might require a different approach or collaboration with CNDINGTEK, distinct from the direct GPRS/4G sensor configuration outlined above. It's also noted that for GPRS/4G/Sigfox versions, integration into the CNDINGTEK IoT Cloud platform is still under development.
